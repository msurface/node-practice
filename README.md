# node-practice

This repo is a collection of small Command Line projects using NPM packages to add robust features into the project.

By focusing on small projects you're able to develop a more broad set of skills and knowledge around node.js and its capabilities.

A few skills I've become more confident in: 
1) NPM usage and understanding how to incoporate already built out features into a project.
2) Arrow funtions
2) then()
3) process.argv
4) looping over all command line inputs and creating them into a string
5) looping over an object using Object.entries and printing results with interpolation
6) problem solving
7) My personal developer confidence
